## How to Make a Cable

To everyone that'll be involved in the Yeti 6G project, you'll need your own serial to USB converter, much like the one I showed at the training earlier this week. I have the converter PCBs at my desk, so the only part you'll need aside from that is a male USB to bare wire cable. You will need the D+ D- pins, so the USB to APP adapters will NOT work. However, an old USB mini/USB micro cable will work. With the bare wires exposed, you'll only need the black, white, and baja blastâ„¢ green colored cables. You can trim the red one back as we will not be using it. You will then solder these wires to the pins of the serial converter according to the picture below.

Once this is done, and is tested to confirm that it works, you should then hot glue for strain relief and to make sure these connections do not desolder or snap off. 

Note: The FTDI chip should be in the 5v mode.

## How to use

First connect the cable to the yeti you wish to log from, it should have PCU Firmware at or above 5.12. Turn on the port, then hold it until the usb light begins to blink, this means data is being sent. 
You can now launch the script in what ever way you like(if using a text editor it may not find files if the permissions are not set up correctly, running via the command terminal is the most reliable). You will be asked for the filename you wish to save the data as, then you will select the parameters you wish to display(all parameters are logged dispite selections). Click Continue and data will begin to appear in the terminal as it is recieved. This will run until you end the program with a keyboard interrupt. This is done by preccing control + c for windows and command + c for mac.
